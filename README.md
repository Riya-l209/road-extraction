# 🛣 Road Extraction using U-Net

This is a *deep learning project* for extracting roads from satellite images using a *U-Net architecture*.  
The model was trained on the *Massachusetts Roads Dataset* and deployed as an interactive *Streamlit app*.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ Upload satellite images (JPG/PNG)  
✅ Get predicted *road masks* in seconds  
✅ Lightweight and works on CPU or GPU  
✅ Deployed publicly using *Hugging Face Spaces*
